# Serial Studio

[![Build Status](https://github.com/Serial-Studio/Serial-Studio/workflows/Build/badge.svg)](#)

Serial Studio is a multi-platform, multi-purpose serial data visualization program. The goal of this project is to allow embedded developers & makers to easily visualize, present & analyze the data generated by their projects and devices, without the need of writing specialized computer software for each project.

The need for this project arose during the development of the Ground Station Software for several CanSat-based competitions in which I participate. It's simply not sustainable to develop and maintain different GSS programs for each competition & project. The smart solution is to have one common Ground Station software and let each CanSat define how the data is presented to the end user by using an extensible communication protocol.

Furthermore, this approach can be extended to almost any type of project that involves some kind of data acquisition & measurement. If you want a more in-depth explanation of why this project exists, and what its all about, check [this](https://www.alex-spataru.com/blog/introducing-serial-studio) blog post.

**NOTE:** Information regarding the communication protocol is provided in the [wiki](https://github.com/Serial-Studio/Serial-Studio/wiki/Communication-Protocol).

This repository makes use of [`git submodule`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-submodule). In order to clone it, you have two options:

One-liner:

    git clone --recursive https://github.com/Serial-Studio/Serial-Studio

Normal procedure:

    git clone https://github.com/Serial-Studio/Serial-Studio
    cd Serial-Studio
    git submodule init
    git submodule update
    
###### Compiling the application

Once you have Qt installed, open *Serial-Studio.pro* in Qt Creator and click the "Run" button.

Alternatively, you can also use the following commands:

	qmake
