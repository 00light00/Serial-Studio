# The hacker's notebook (WIP)

Hi! If you are reading this, you are probably trying to understand how this software works internally. Good for you!

In general, I try to write [DOXYGEN](https://www.doxygen.nl/index.html) comments to explain what each function does. However, this does not help newcomers to understand how a program's source code is organized. For this reason, I will try to explain what each folder & class does in this document. 

Think of this file as an introductory document for colaborators, hackers and geeks. Maybe there are superior and more "pure" ways of doing this, but I really like the simplicity of markdown & `git`.

Of course, if the documentation is not clear enough (or you are a good writer), you are very welcome to fork this project, modify it & create a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests).

## Software architecture

Before explaining what each module does, please take a look at the "high-level" architecture of Serial Studio:

Honestly, explaining this with words would be pretty difficult. If you have any doubts, feel free to use any of the support channels provided by the maintainers of the project.

## Source code organization
